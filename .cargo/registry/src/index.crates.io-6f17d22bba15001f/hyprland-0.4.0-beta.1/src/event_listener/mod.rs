//! # Event Listener Module
//! for documentation go to:
//! * [crate::event_listener::EventStream] for the event listener implementation based on the [futures_lite::Stream] api
//! * [crate::event_listener::EventListener] for the normal [Fn] based event listener
//! * [crate::event_listener::AsyncEventListener] for the [Fn] based event listener which uses closures that return [std::future::Future]s
